Applications collected in the $MIOS32_PATH/app/mios32_test directory
are used to test MIOS32 functions (or hardware) and not intended 
for a public release, since they either require special knowledge 
and careful usage (e.g. sdcard_rw_check will destroy the SD card 
content), special hardware modifications, etc. --- or since they
are not helpful for the enduser at all.
