# this example shows how to create individual LED Ring patterns for Weasels LED Ring/encoder board:
# http://midibox.org/forums/topic/21095-lre-4x1-breakable-rgb-led-ringrotary-encoder-pcb-bulk-order

# the encoder of the SCS is used to control the value which is then displayed by the first RGB LED Ring
# the pattern itself is defined in the NGR file

# note: this approach is not suitable for multiple LED Rings!
# and the definition of patterns can be very cumbersome (see RGBLED_2.NGR file)
# therefore MBNG supports some patterns natively, and if you want to propose new ones,
# just demonstrate with this setup and pass to TK (or integrate into mbng_rgbled.c by yourself)

# see RGBLED_3.NGC for the usage of predefined patterns
